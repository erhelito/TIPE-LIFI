# TIPE LIFI
This is a school project in which we first created an operating communication system through light in ambient light conditions and without optic fiber. It includes multiple corrective systems, allowing us to use the system in a wide range of conditions. Then, we studied the performance of the system, in terms of length of transmission, thanks to the study of our laser dispersion.
